# eCLD\_AlarmsCommandGetAlarmCommandSend

```
teZCL_Status eCLD_AlarmsCommandGetAlarmCommandSend(
    uint8 u8SourceEndPointId,
    uint8 u8DestinationEndPointId,
    tsZCL_Address *psDestinationAddress,
    uint8 *pu8TransactionSequenceNumber);

```

## Description 

This function can be used on an Alarms cluster client to send a Get Alarm command to a cluster server. This command requests information on the logged alarm with the earliest timestamp in the device’s Alarms table. As a result of this command, the retrieved entry is also deleted from the table.

The requested information is returned by the server in a Get Alarm response. When this response is received, an E\_CLD\_ALARMS\_CMD\_GET\_ALARM\_RESPONSE event is generated on the client.

You are required to provide a pointer to a location to receive a Transaction Sequence Number \(TSN\) for the request. The TSN in the response is set to match the TSN in the request, allowing an incoming response to be paired with a request. This is useful when sending more than one request to the same destination endpoint.

## Parameters 

-   *u8SourceEndPointId*: Number of the local endpoint through which to send the request. This parameter is used both to send the message and to identify the instance of the shared structure holding the required attribute values
-   *u8DestinationEndPointId*: Number of the endpoint on the remote node to which the request is sent. This parameter is ignored when sending to address types eZCL\_AMBOUND and eZCL\_AMGROUP
-   *psDestinationAddress*: Pointer to a structure holding the address of the node to which the request is sent
-   *psDestinationAddress*: Pointer to a location to receive the Transaction Sequence Number \(TSN\) of the request

## Returns 

-   E\_ZCL\_SUCCESS
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_PARAMETER\_NULL
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_EP\_RANGE
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_EP\_UNKNOWN
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_CLUSTER\_NOT\_FOUND
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_ZBUFFER\_FAIL
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_ZTRANSMIT\_FAIL

If an error is returned by the ZigBee PRO stack function which is invoked by this function to transmit the data, this error may be obtained by calling **eZCL\_GetLastZpsError\(\)**.
