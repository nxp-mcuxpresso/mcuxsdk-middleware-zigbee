# eCLD\_BasicCommandResetToFactoryDefaultsSend

```
teZCL_Status eCLD_BasicCommandResetToFactoryDefaultsSend(
    uint8 u8SourceEndPointId,
    uint8 u8DestinationEndPointId,
    tsZCL_Address *psDestinationAddress,
    uint8 *pu8TransactionSequenceNumber);

```

## Description 

This function can be called on a client device to send a ‘Reset To Factory Defaults’ command, requesting the recipient server device to reset to its factory defaults. The recipient device generates a callback event on the endpoint on which the Basic cluster was registered.

If used, the ‘`Reset To Factory Defaults`’ command must be enabled in the compile-time options on both the client and server, as described in [Section 8.6](compile-time_options.md#id_109edd98-be6b-4f11-b13a-edf11be44178).

You are required to provide a pointer to a location to receive a Transaction Sequence Number \(TSN\) for the request. The TSN in the response is set to match the TSN in the request, allowing an incoming response to be paired with a request. This is useful when sending more than one request to the same destination endpoint.

## Parameters 

-   *u8SourceEndPointId*: Number of the local endpoint through which to send the request. This parameter is used both to send the command and to identify the instance of the shared structure holding the required attribute values.
-   *u8DestinationEndPointId*: Number of the endpoint on the remote node to which the request is sent. This parameter is ignored when sending to address types eZCL\_AMBOUND and eZCL\_AMGROUP
-   *psDestinationAddress*: Pointer to a structure holding the address of the node to which the request is sent
-   *psDestinationAddress*: Pointer to a location to receive the Transaction Sequence Number \(TSN\) of the request

## Returns 

-   E\_ZCL\_SUCCESS
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_PARAMETER\_NULL
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_EP\_RANGE
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_EP\_UNKNOWN
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_CLUSTER\_NOT\_FOUND
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_ZBUFFER\_FAIL
-   E\_ZCL\_ERR\_ZTRANSMIT\_FAIL

If an error is returned by the ZigBee PRO stack function which is invoked by this function to transmit the data, this error may be obtained by calling **eZCL\_GetLastZpsError\(\)**.
